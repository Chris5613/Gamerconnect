Work Today:
I had to rewatch lectures on FASTApi to reiterate over some points that I was not fully understanding. I wanted to further build my understanding instead of just copying what makes sense in order to become more proficient for the future when utilizing FASTApi. This will prepare me to finish all my endpoint work this weekend.

My team on the other hand, finished a handful of endpoints, and I am working on the gamers get endpoint.
