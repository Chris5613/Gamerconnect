Today we worked on solving some more issues in regards to our pgadmin, one of our fastapi services that wasn't running, and the react app not being able to run on windows. We were able to solve all problems and we created our two migration files for each fastapi service. I started to work on our user sign up endpoint on the backend.

I was able to finish both and created the merge request which my teammates approved of and I was able to merged both. I also was able to approve two of my other teammates request that were merged.

Today I worked on getting my last endpoint up for being able to update a user on request, I had a short problem with passing ID but Gabe helped me figure out I was passing the wrong ID and afterwards I was able to merge it in to main. I started to work on the main page for our website, styling the navbar and the main hero, and also adding react router and getting that set up.
