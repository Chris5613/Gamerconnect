Today we worked on solving some more issues in regards to our pgadmin, one of our fastapi services that wasn't running, and the react app not being able to run on windows. We were able to solve all problems and we created our two migration files for each fastapi service. I started to work on our user sign up endpoint on the backend.

Today I worked on creating two endpoints one for DELETE and one for POST for posts and user respectively. I was able to finish both and created the merge request which my teammates approved of and I was able to merged both. I also was able to approve two of my other teammates request that were merged.
